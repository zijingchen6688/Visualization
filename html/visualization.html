  <h1 align="left">Narrative Visualization</h1>
  
  <h2>Messaging</h2>
  
  <p>After analyzing dataset for crimes reported from 2015 - 2018 in Boston, it can be summarized:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Larceny is by far the most common type of serious crime.</li>
    <li>Serious crimes are most likely to occur in the afternoon and evening.</li>
	<li>Serious crimes are most likely to occur on Friday and least likely to occur on Sunday.</li>
	<li>Serious crimes are most likely to occur in the summer and early fall, and least likely to occur 
	in the winter (except for January, which has a crime rate more like the summer).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Visual Structure</h2>

  <p>This narrative visualization follows a "martini glass" structure consisting of four author-driven
  scenes followed by the last scene in which the reader can explore the dataset.</p>
  
  <p>This narrative visualization uses a hybrid structure and consists of scenes,
    annotations, parameters, and triggers.</p>


  <h2>Scenes</h2>
  Four author-driven scenes follow an identical layout. The intention is to draw the reader's attention to the chart and maintain through the transition between scenes. The position of elements is maintained across all scenes consistent to keep the reader oriented on the chart. Transitions are used between scenes to make the connection between scenes.

  <p>Scenes can be navigated with page buttons at the top of the display which shows the current scene
    number highlighted and allows the reader to move to a different scene in the story:</p>	
	<ul>
	<li>Scene-0: Introduction to the visualization.</li>
	<li>Scene-1: The first scene shows a number of crimes reported by types.</li>
	<li>Scene-2: The second scene shows a number of crimes reported by months.</li>
	<li>Scene-3: The third scene shows a number of crimes reported by day of a week.</li>
	<li>Scene-4: The fourth scene shows a number of crimes reported by an hour of a day.</li>
	<li>Scene-5: The fifth scene shows the same kind of data as the fourth scene but here, 
	the reader has the ability to see data by every offense type 
	and sort it to see when those crimes are most likely to occur in a day.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Scenes are organized in a way that reader can make sense out of it. Showing the first scene as a graph with category of crimes and its frequency. This information sets up the stage about the story. Then comes, crimes happening over the months to show how likely a crime can happen over the year. Then, frequency of crime over days of the week and over hours of a day. In the last scene, the story of frequency over hours of a day continues but it allows users to filter data based on type of a crime to visualize the data better and the reader can sort the data to see when a crime is most likely to occur in a day.
	</p>

<h2>Annotations</h2>
  <p>Annotations are added with the data point in the story 
to explain the significance of the data. It helps the reader to explain key points from the chart.</p>

  <p>Annotations for each scene are added at the start of the scene and removed during transitions so that the reader is
    drawn to the new annotation and data point in the story.</p>

  <p>Annotations use the same template - light gray rectangle with black text and a line directed near to data point on the
    chart.</p>

  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  The common parameters for all scenes are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Scene number</b> - scenes are rendered in the same window and scene number is a parameter
    that drives the presentation.</li>
    <li><b>Chart axis and Text</b> - these elements are parameters which change as per the selected scene.</li>
  </ul>

  Parameters specific to the author-driven scenes (1 - 4) are: 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Annotation aiming point, position and text</b> - annotations are parameterized with an aiming point,
a text offset and the content of the annotation</li>
  </ul>
 
  Parameters specific to the reader-drive scene (5th) are:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Offense Type Selection</b> - The reader can select one of the offenses to visualize data over the hours of the day</li>
    <li><b>Sorted Data Checkbox</b> - The reader can use this checkbox to sort the data in descending order of frequency of the crime</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The scene number drives many of the other parameters such as charts, annotations 
and explanation text with every chart.</p>
  <p>The reader uses scene numbers to navigate between different scenes and transitions 
are implemented throughout the visualization.</p>
  <p>For the reader-driven scene, there are two parameters: selection and checkbox. The visualization
    must track what is selected and whether the checkbox is checked or not to show appropriate data to the reader.</p>

  <h2>Triggers</h2>
  <p>The first trigger is the at the completion of the HTML page load, which invokes the functions to initialize the visualization and introduction scene.</p>
  <p>This is followed by preparing data for different charts from the CSV file.</p>

  <p>The user navigates through the presentation by clicking scene numbers shown in the top left corner.</p>
  <p>On the reader-driven scene, selecting an offense type triggers chart to be updated with relevant data
and selection of sorted data checkbox, sorts the data in descending order.</p>
